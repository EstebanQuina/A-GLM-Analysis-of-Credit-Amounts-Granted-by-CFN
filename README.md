# A-GLM-Analysis-of-Credit-Amounts-Granted-by-CFN
This study analyzes the determinants of credit volume granted
by Corporación Financiera Nacional (CFN) in Ecuador from January
2022 to September 2025. Using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with
a Gamma distribution and a log link function, the analysis assesses the
impact of various predictors on loan magnitude. The results reveal sig-
nificant stratification in credit allocation, with Corporate Productive
Credit and the Financial and Insurance Activities sector emerging as the
primary drivers of high-volume financing. Geographically, operations in
Pastaza and Galapagos demonstrated a positive association with larger
credit grants, likely reflecting distinct regional economic dynamics. Con-
versely, Real Estate Activities and Factoring Operations were strongly
associated with lower credit volumes, consistent with their transactional
nature. While the model successfully ranks the relative importance of
these drivers, residual diagnostics indicate a heavy-tailed distribution in
the response variable that the Gamma assumption does not fully capture,
leading to under-prediction of extreme values. The findings suggest that
while the current model provides robust insights for portfolio segmen-
tation, future iterations should explore alternative distributions, such as
the Inverse Gaussian, to better accommodate high-leverage observations.
